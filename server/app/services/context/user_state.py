"""
User state inference module for detecting user's emotional, purposive, and situational context.

This module infers the user's current state from recent conversation messages
using LLM structured output. The inferred state is injected into the prompt's
instruction area as natural language to guide the agent's response strategy.

Three-dimensional model:
- Emotion: user's current emotional state (affects response tone)
- Purpose: user's current conversational goal (affects response content direction)
- Situation: user's physical context (affects response constraints)

Intent type is implicitly derived from purpose + situation, not modeled separately.
