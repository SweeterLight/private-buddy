"""
Narrative generation module for creating background stories.

This module handles the generation of background narratives from summary
and RAG segments. The narrative provides a coherent context for the LLM
to understand the conversation history.

The narrative generation process:
1. Combine summary content (if available)
2. Combine relevant RAG segments (if available)
3. Use LLM to generate a coherent narrative from the agent's perspective

Narrative Perspective Design:
- Uses internal focalization (agent's viewpoint) rather than external focalization
- The agent is addressed as "You" to enhance immersion and continuity
- This helps the LLM naturally continue the conversation rather than "retell" it

Integrate the above information into a coherent background narrative with the following requirements:
1. Use second-person perspective (address the agent as "You"). For example: "You have been discussing X with the user. The user mentioned..."
2. Preserve key information and context
3. The narrative should be coherent and flowing, not a simple list
4. Output only the narrative content, without additional explanations

IMPORTANT: The narrative MUST preserve the original language of the conversation.
- If the conversation is in Chinese, write the narrative in Chinese.
- If the conversation is in English, write the narrative in English.
- If the conversation contains multiple languages, the narrative may also contain multiple languages.
- Do NOT translate between languages. Maintain information fidelity."""
