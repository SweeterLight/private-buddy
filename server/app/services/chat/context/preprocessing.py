"""
Query preprocessing module for intelligent routing and query transformation.

This module handles the preprocessing of user queries before they are sent to the
retrieval or LLM systems. It includes:
- Query type classification (clear, ambiguous, vague, no_query)
- Query rewriting for ambiguous queries with context
- Clarification generation for vague queries

The preprocessing pipeline ensures that queries are optimized for retrieval
and LLM processing.
