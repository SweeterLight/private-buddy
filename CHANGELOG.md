## [0.0.10] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- ResizableCard component for draggable card-based UI layout

### Changed
- BashTool: use `cmd /c` on Windows instead of `bash -c`
- Embedding option label: "Default" → "Not used"
- Chat input placeholder: "Finally remembered me? Shift+Enter for new line"
- Replace console.log with logger in api.ts

### Fixed
- Agent avatar not persisted when creating with avatar selected


## [0.0.9] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Electron Desktop Application**: cross-platform desktop packaging for macOS, Windows, and Linux with one-click build commands (`npm run dist:mac|win|linux`)
- **Go Backend**: complete rewrite of backend from Python to Go with native cross-compilation support (GOOS/GOARCH)
- **Dynamic Port Allocation**: Electron main process automatically assigns free port to Go server, frontend dynamically resolves via IPC
- **Custom Title Bar**: VS Code-style title bar with `titleBarStyle: 'hidden'` + `titleBarOverlay`, native window controls (traffic lights on macOS, min/max/close on Win/Linux) overlaid on web content
- **Splash Screen**: loading screen during Go server startup with health check polling
- **IPC Bridge**: secure communication between renderer and main process via contextBridge (`getServerPort`, `getAppVersion`, `getPlatform`, `onBackendStatus`, `onBackendError`)

### Changed
- **Backend Stack**: FastAPI → Gin, SQLAlchemy → GORM, langchain-openai → go-openai, numpy → custom cosine similarity
- **SQLite Driver**: switched to pure-Go `modernc.org/sqlite` (no CGO required) enabling hassle-free cross-compilation
- **Service Scripts**: `start.sh`/`stop.sh`/`restart.sh` converted from Python (uvicorn) to Go binary management with PID file tracking
- **Vite Config**: `base: './'` for relative paths, `outDir` to project-level `web-dist/` for electron-builder packaging
- **Header Styling**: height reduced from 56px to 38px, logo/icon/text scaled down to match native window controls

### Removed
- **Python Backend**: entire `server/app/` directory (API, services, models, schemas) deleted
- **Python Dependencies**: `pyproject.toml`, `setup.sh`, `venv/` no longer needed
- **Manual Database Init**: `server/database/` removed (Go uses GORM AutoMigrate)
- **Unused Assets**: `web/public/icons.svg` (social icon sprite with no references)

### Performance
- Backend binary size reduced from ~100 MB+ (PyInstaller) to ~33 MB (go build)
- Startup time reduced from 2-5 seconds (Python interpreter) to <1 second (native binary)
- Cross-platform builds now possible from a single macOS machine


## [0.0.8] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- **Database Migration: MySQL → SQLite**: replaced MySQL with SQLite for desktop application compatibility, eliminating the need for users to install and configure a database server
- **Engine Configuration**: removed MySQL-specific `pool_pre_ping` and `pool_recycle`, added SQLite `check_same_thread=False` and WAL mode pragma
- **SQL Migration Scripts**: consolidated all incremental SQL files (0.0.1 through 0.0.7) into a single `full_init.sql` for fresh database initialization
- **Database Initialization**: `init_db.sh` now supports `init` (full) and `upgrade` (incremental) modes, uses `sqlite3` client
- **ORM Models**: removed `comment=` parameters (SQLite does not support column comments); fixed `SearchConfig.updated_at` to be NOT NULL with server_default
- **Task Loop LLM Configuration**: checkpoint client now uses agent's LLM config instead of separate environment variables, eliminating redundant configuration
- **Data Directory**: unified all application data under `~/PrivateBuddyData/` (db, chroma, workspace, avatars)
- **Environment Variables**: simplified to `DATA_ROOT` only; `DATABASE_URL`, `CHROMA_PERSIST_DIR`, and `LLM_*` variables removed

### Removed
- **pymysql dependency**: no longer needed after SQLite migration
- **LLM environment variables**: `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_API_KEY` replaced by database-stored agent LLM configs
- **migrate_mysql_to_sqlite.py**: one-time migration script deleted after use

### Added
- **Auto data directory creation**: `PrivateBuddyData/db` directory automatically created on application startup
- **SQLite PRAGMA configuration**: WAL journal mode and foreign keys enabled on connection
- **Database Version Tracking**: `db_versions` table and `DBVersion` model for schema version management
- **Version API**: `GET /api/version` endpoint returns database schema version from `db_versions` table
- **Upgrade SQL Directory**: `sql/upgrade/` for incremental schema changes in future versions


## [0.0.7] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Cached Narrative Generation**: narrative generated alongside summary in background task, stored in `historical_summaries.narrative` field with atomic write, eliminating real-time narrative generation bottleneck during chat processing
- **CachedStaticFiles**: custom StaticFiles class with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400` for avatar images, enabling browser-side caching

### Changed
- **Parallel LLM Calls**: User State inference and Query Preprocessing now run concurrently via `asyncio.gather` when V >= N, reducing combined latency from sum to max of both calls
- **Narrative Retrieval**: follows same versioning policy as summary — get latest available version without requiring alignment with current message count
- **Segments Section**: RAG-retrieved segments now rendered as independent section with narrative-style transition in context assembly

### Performance
- Chat response time reduced from 60-90s to 25-50s (V >= N scenarios)
- Avatar HTTP requests eliminated for 24h after first load via browser caching


## [0.0.6] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Markdown Rendering**: assistant messages rendered with react-markdown + remark-gfm
- **Custom Agent Avatar**: upload, store, and display custom avatar images for each agent
- **Project Logo**: display favicon.svg in header next to app title
- **Message Time Formatting**: contextual display — same day (time only), yesterday ("Yesterday" + time), older (full date + time) with i18n support
- **Agent Avatar in Chat**: AI messages show the agent's avatar alongside the name
- **LoadingSpinner Component**: braille rotation animation replacing typing dots for streaming messages
- **ConfigIcon Component**: unified icon rendering for agent/LLM/embedding/search/language types
- **CSS Theme Variables**: centralized `--color-*` variables for consistent theming

### Changed
- **Settings Panel**: restructured as right-side drawer with card grid overview instead of main area switching
- **Language Switching**: from dropdown menu to card-based selection
- **Agent List**: removed expand/collapse arrows, added avatar display
- **Settings Labels**: simplified ("LLM Config" → "LLM", "Agent Config" → "Agent", etc.)
- **Inline Colors**: replaced hardcoded hex values with CSS variables across all components

### Fixed
- Scroll-to-top issue when opening historical sessions


## [0.0.5] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **Finite Working Memory**: iteration window for context visibility, older iterations discarded directly
- **Reader-Oriented Notes**: structured append-only notes.md via write_notes tool, bridging LLM statelessness
- **Forced Checkpoint**: mandatory notes write when distance from last write reaches window boundary
- **Workspace Structure**: `.meta/` (task.md + notes.md) + `output/` two-channel isolation
- **Task Requirement Rewriting**: ambiguous user messages rewritten into clear, self-contained task descriptions

### Changed
- Refactored `agent/` to `task/` for naming consistency with task execution semantics
- Moved chat context logic under `chat/` and created shared DTO module to eliminate circular imports


## [0.0.4] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Agent Execution System**: ReAct pattern with minimal tool set (Bash + Web Search)
- **Interaction Boundary**: separate storage for agent-world interactions, isolated from user conversation
- **Search Engine Integration**: configurable Tavily/DuckDuckGo with automatic tool availability detection


## [0.0.3] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Narrative Optimization**: internal focalization for background story, cohesive section transitions
- **User State Inference**: three-dimensional model (emotion, purpose, situation) for response strategy guidance


## [0.0.2] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Context engineering: automatic conversation summary and background narrative generation
- Smart query preprocessing: query classification, rewriting, and clarification
- Character settings: customizable agent personality and style
- RAG integration: retrieve relevant historical context for better responses

### Changed

- Optimized LLM prompts for better multilingual support


## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Basic chat functionality with AI agents
- Agent and LLM configuration management
- Session and message history
- SSE streaming for chat responses
- Multi-language support (English and Chinese)
